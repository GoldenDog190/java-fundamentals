# Linter App - Lab 03

## File I/O
* This app contains the  method, which reads through gates.js file line by line, and will generate an error message whenever it finds a line that doesnâ€™t end in a semi-colon. This acts as a linter and filters through the code, and tells you if it has any errors. Has three JS files that are check for errors by the Java in this app. I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour on this lab.
