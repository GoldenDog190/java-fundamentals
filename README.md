## Java Fundamentals
  * Lab 1: Main.java - Main class with pluralize method, flipping coins method, and command line clock method.
  * Lab 2: ArrayLoop.java and ArrayLoops.java - In the basiclibrary folder has the IntelliJ IDEA code, which I used to build a library that has ArrayLoopTest.java and ArrayLoops.java files in it. They contain the roll method that rolled a dice, containsDuplicates method that could detect if an array contains a duplicate, getAverage method to calculate an average, and averageOfAverage method that used an array of an array to calculate the average value for each array. I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour on this lab.
  * Lab 3: Maps.java - In the basiclibrary folder is the Maps class that has a weather meathod that keeps track of weather data with the weatherData method and there is a tally function that is used to tally up all of the votes using the tally method. I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour on this lab.
  * Lab 3: In the linter folder is the App for the linter. More information in the linter folder README.md. I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour on this lab.
  * Lab 6 & 7: In the inheritance folder is the Library for the inheritance library. More information on lab 06 & 07 in the inheritance folder README.md. I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour on the 6th lab.
