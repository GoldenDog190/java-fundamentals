## Java Fundamentals
  * Main.java - Main class with pluralize method, flipping coins method, and command line clock method.
  * ArrayLoopTest.java and ArrayLoops.java - In the basiclibrary folder has the IntelliJ IDEA code, which I used to build a library that has ArrayLoopTest.java and ArrayLoops.java files in it. They contain the roll method, containsDuplicates method, getAverage method, and averageOfAverage method. I collaborated with Edward Hou and James Mansour on this lab.
